scowl (2020.12.07-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Wordlists are now sorted with the -d option to sort, which only sorts
    in dictionary order instead of sorting in LC_SORT=C order. (Closes:
    #987857)

scowl (2019.10.06-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The scowl binary package now distributes all of its wordlists in UTF-8
    rather than iso8859-1. This is different than the upstream default of
    iso8859-1.
